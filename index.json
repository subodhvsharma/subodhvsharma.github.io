This is a direct result of programmers running away from designing abstractions and not sufficiently focussing on simplicity and clarity. Could we instead work with a simple language that captures the essential aspects of program design before we decide to develop such programs? Would it not be great to not only state the software abstractions of systems succinctly, but also analyse them fully automatically akin to the continuous integration model of software development? In this course, we shall study one such specification language called Alloy and learn to model system abstractions succinctly and incrementally. We shall also learn to apply Alloy analysis tool to models which will facilitate in finding deeps flaws early in the design process without having to explicitly write a ton of unit tests.\nReference Book Software Abstractions by Daniel Jackson\nReference Links  Alloy Online Tutorial Alloy Tutorial Slides  Guest Talks   Algorithmic Analysis of a Model Checking Partial Order Reduction Scheme Using Alloy by Prof. Stephen Siegel, Univesity of Delaware.\n  Exploring Memory Models using the Alloy Analyzer by Prof. John Wickerson, Imperial College London.\n  ","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"a5a0d0f94d11d645e21107cedf02b7c7","permalink":"https://subodhvsharma.github.io/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","section":"course","summary":"Sem I (2020-21)","tags":null,"title":"COV 882 Special Module in Software Systems -- Software Abstractions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"General Information  Co-Instructor: Subodh Sharma (email: svs at cse.iitd.ac.in)  Semester: II, 2019-2020 Timings: Mon/Thur 09:30-11:00  Class Venue: LH 108 (Group 31-40)  Lab Venue: LH 502-505 \n Notice  All mails to the course instructor MUST have COL100 as the subject.

Course Overview Click here to see what the Courses of Study booklet has to say.\nCOL100: Introduction to Computer Science is intended for First Year B. Tech. students. The course COL100 addresses on the following issues:\n Problem formulation in a precise and concise fashion and independent of language considerations. The design of an algorithm from the problem specification \u0026ndash; its correctness and analysis of its efficiency. The intermediate steps in the design of a program from an algorithm through a process of step-wise refinement. Language dependent considerations may be used in this process, but not elsewhere.  The emphasis throughout the course is in the analysis required while designing correct and efficient algorithms. The course is intended to teach a student a systematic process of design - beginning with problem formulation from an informal specification, through convincing arguments to algorithms, the analysis of their correctness and efficiency, and finally arriving at programs through a process of step-wise refinement. A programming language bias is avoided and programs are developed in both imperative and functional styles.\nThe first part of the course introduces the basics of the functional and imperative models of computation, recursive and iterative processes, and the basics of programming using higher-order functions. The programming languages used for functional and imperative programming are Standard ML and Python, respectively.\nThe second part of the course introduces data-directed programming. It emphasizes on programming with records, lists, trees, arrays and developing abstract data types.\nThe third part of the course addresses the issues in design and analysis of simple algorithms. Examples are taken from Divide and conquer, Backtracking, Numerical algorithms, Randomized algorithms and Geometric algorithms.\nReferences The primary references is going to be the Lecture Notes on Introduction to Computing developed by Prof. Subhashis Banerjee and Prof. S.

The technique is used successfully in diverse domains such as computer-aided education, software engineering, software verification etc. In this course we will discuss modern synthesis approaches by discussing foundational as well as recent research advances in this area. Topics covered in this course will include enumerative syntax-guided synthesis, counterexample-guided synthesis, stochastic synthesis and machine-learning based synthesis.\nAcademic Integrity: Plagiarism is viewed very seriously. Any case of copying (or allowing to copy) of written text or code would immediately be awarded 0 in the assignment/exam and a grade drop. Depending on the nature of plagiarism, the student could also be refered to the disciplanary committee with a fail grade. All written/programming tasks are to performed on your own, other than when group-work is explicitly specified.\nLecture Material  Sr. No. Topic  Supplementary Reading     1\t  Course modalities; Introduction       2, 3   Denali: A Goal-directed Superoptimizer     Stochastic Superoptimization (ASPLOS'13)   Equality saturation: a new approach to optimization (POPL'09)   Automatic generation of peephole superoptimizers (ASPLOS'06)   Synthesis of loop-free programs (PLDI'11)   Scaling up Superoptimization (ASPLOS'16)       4-6  Program Synthesis by Sketching     Sketching Stencils (PLDI'07)   Sketching Concurrent Data strucutures (PLDI'08)   Optimizing Synthesis with Metasketches (POPL'16)       7-8  Syntax Guided Synthesis \u0026 Search-based Program Synthesis     Synthesis Through Unification (CAV'15)       9-11  Spreadsheet Data Manipulation Using Examples     Synthesizing Data Structure Transformations from Input-Output Examples (PLDI'15)  Test-driven synthesis (PLDI'14)  Learning Syntactic Program Transformations from Examples (ICSE'17)  Scaling Enumerative Program Synthesis via Divide and Conquer (TACAS'17)   Synthesizing highly expressive SQL queries from input-output examples (PLDI'17)       12-13  From Program Verification to Program Synthesis     ICE: A robust Framework for Learning Invariants (CAV'14)   Type-and-example-directed Program Synthesis (PLDI'15)  Program Synthesis using Abstraction Refinement (POPL'18)  Program Synthesis using Conflict-Driven Learning (PLDI'18)      14-16  Stochastic Program Optimization     Data-driven Equivalence Checking (OOPSLA'13)   Finding deep compiler bugs via guided stochastic program mutation (OOPSlA'15)  Guided, stochastic model-based GUI testing of Android apps (FSE'17)  Sampling for Bayesian Program Learning (NIPS'16)  Code Completion with Statistical Language Models (PLDI'14)       17   Course Project Discussions       18-22  Neural Program Learning under Noisy I/O (ICML'17)     Nueral-guided Deductive Search for Realtime Program Synthesis from Examples (ICLR'18)   Learning Programs from Noisy Data (POPL'16)  Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis (ArXiv'16)  Learn \u0026 Fuzz: Machine learning for input fuzzing (ASE'17)      23-28   Course Project Presentations       ","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"0ef9dc04370050d98615f5f849ba1310","permalink":"https://subodhvsharma.github.io/course/sptopicsinpl-program-synthesis/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/sptopicsinpl-program-synthesis/","section":"course","summary":"Sem I (2019-20)","tags":null,"title":"COL 871 Special Topics in Programming Languages -- Program Synthesis","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"1.

First use the algorithm given by the following functional description: $fib(1) = 1; fib(2) = 1; fib(n) = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)$ for $n \u0026gt; 2$. Also develop iterative algorithms for the same problem. The integer square root of $n$ is the integer $k$ such that $k^2 \\leq n \u0026lt; (k+1)^2$. The integer square root can be computed using the following inductive process:  Compute the integer square root $i$ of $m = n ,\\mbox{div}, 4$ recursively. We then have that $i^2 \\leq m \u0026lt; (i+1)^2$. Since $m$ and $i$ are integers we have that $(m+1) \u0026lt;= (i+1)^2$. We thus have $(2i)^2 \\leq 4m \\leq n \u0026lt; 4m + 4 \\leq (2i + 2)^2$. Hence we have that the integer square root of $n$ is either $2i$ or $2i+1$. Write a recursive ML program corresponding to the above algorithm. Indicate the type of the function and derive the number of steps required.   Study the problem of computing perfect numbers from the the Lecture notes Example 3.13 and implement the ML program. Also study the following discussion on scope rules. You will be questioned on this problem during the demonstration.

Construct an Alloy model of FSMs by adding constraints and having the analyzer solve them, generate a variety of examples of machines:\n A deterministic machine, in which each state has at most one successor; A non-deterministic machine, in which some states have more than one successor; A machine with unreachable states; A machine without unreachable states; A connected machine in which every state is reachable from every other state; A machine with a deadlock: a reachable state that has no successors; A machine with a livelock: the possibility of an infinite execution in which a state that is always reachable is never reached.  Modeling Concurrent Program Executions [CHALLENGING] Semantics of any program is generally defined by a set of executions. An execution of a program is composed of events. Events are either read (or write) from (or to) a location or fences. Events can also be classified into those that access atomic locations and those that access non-atomic ($nal$) locations. Events from the same thread are ordered w.r.t. each other via a total order called sequenced-before ($sb$). Other relations that may exist between events are:\n dependency relations such as address ($ad$), control ($cd$) or data ($dd$) dependency whether events are from the same thread ($sthd$) or accessing the same location ($ sloc$) reads-from (rf) relation \u0026ndash; a relation containing edges to read actions from the write actions whose values they take, coherence-order ($co$) \u0026ndash; a total order on distinct writes to the same atomic location) reads-from-external ( $rfe \\overset{\\mathrm{def}}{=} rf \\setminus sthd $)  The constaints on the structure of basic well-formed executions are:\n Read, write, fence and $nal$ are drawn from the events $E$ that appear in the execution Fence operations are distinct from read and write events $sb$ is a intra-thread and strict partial order the nature of address, control and data dependencies (i.e., their relation to read and write events) $rf$ is well-formed if the related writes and read are to the same location and is injective. Simialrly, $co$ is well-formed if the writes are to the same location forms a strict partial order. $rfe$ is derived from $rf$.  The above is not an exhaustive list. Some other simpler constriants coming straight from the natural definition of the relations have been left out. One can refer to the paper Mathematizing C++ Concurrency for natural definition of the relations mentioned above.\nRelease ($rel$) and acquire ($acq$) are atomic write and read events, respectively. A fence can also have release or acquire semantics. A consistent execution of a program with release and acquire events has the following constraints:\n A happens-before ($hb$) relation \u0026ndash; created from $sb$ and the syncrhonisation of release and acquire events in the execution. $hb$ edges between events accessing the same location, together with $rf, co$ and $fr$ must not form cycles. Note that $fr$ relates each read to all of the writes that are coherence-ordered later than the write that the read observed.  Implement the basic execution modeling in Alloy and extend your model to the release-acquire fragment of C11. Show litmus execution behaviours of consistent executions, data race-free and with race executions.\nReport  Create a report in latex and explain how you iteratively refined the model and how did Alloy help you to indentify counter-examples in your modeling process.
