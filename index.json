This is a direct result of programmers running away from designing abstractions and not sufficiently focussing on simplicity and clarity. Could we instead work with a simple language that captures the essential aspects of program design before we decide to develop such programs? Would it not be great to not only state the software abstractions of systems succinctly, but also analyse them fully automatically akin to the continuous integration model of software development? In this course, we shall study one such specification language called Alloy and learn to model system abstractions succinctly and incrementally. We shall also learn to apply Alloy analysis tool to models which will facilitate in finding deeps flaws early in the design process without having to explicitly write a ton of unit tests.\nReference Book Software Abstractions by Daniel Jackson\nReference Links Alloy Online Tutorial Alloy Tutorial Slides Guest Talks Algorithmic Analysis of a Model Checking Partial Order Reduction Scheme Using Alloy by Prof. Stephen Siegel, Univesity of Delaware.\nExploring Memory Models using the Alloy Analyzer by Prof. John Wickerson, Imperial College London.\n","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"a5a0d0f94d11d645e21107cedf02b7c7","permalink":"https://subodhvsharma.github.io/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","section":"course","summary":"Sem I (2020-21)","tags":null,"title":"COV 882 Special Module in Software Systems -- Software Abstractions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"General Information Co-Instructor: Subodh Sharma (email: svs at cse.iitd.ac.in) Semester: I, 2022-2023 Timings: Mon/Thur 16:30-18:00 Class Venue: LH 121 (Group 11-20) Lab Venue: LH 502-505 Notice All mails to the course instructor MUST have COL100 as the subject.

Course Overview Click here to see what the Courses of Study booklet has to say.\nCOL100: Introduction to Computer Science is intended for First Year B. Tech. students. The course COL100 addresses on the following issues:\nProblem formulation in a precise and concise fashion and independent of language considerations. The design of an algorithm from the problem specification – its correctness and analysis of its efficiency. The intermediate steps in the design of a program from an algorithm through a process of step-wise refinement. Language dependent considerations may be used in this process, but not elsewhere. The emphasis throughout the course is in the analysis required while designing correct and efficient algorithms. The course is intended to teach a student a systematic process of design - beginning with problem formulation from an informal specification, through convincing arguments to algorithms, the analysis of their correctness and efficiency, and finally arriving at programs through a process of step-wise refinement. A programming language bias is avoided and programs are developed in both imperative and functional styles.\nThe first part of the course introduces the basics of the functional and imperative models of computation, recursive and iterative processes, and the basics of programming using higher-order functions. The programming language used for functional and imperative programming is Python.\nThe second part of the course introduces data-directed programming. It emphasizes on programming with records, lists, trees, arrays and developing abstract data types.\nThe third part of the course addresses the issues in design and analysis of simple algorithms. Examples are taken from Divide and conquer, Backtracking, Numerical algorithms, Randomized algorithms and Geometric algorithms.\nReferences The primary references is going to be the\nLecture Notes on Introduction to Computing .\nOther References\nStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman with Julie Sussman, MIT Press, 1985.\nHow to solve it by Computer by R.

The technique is used successfully in diverse domains such as computer-aided education, software engineering, software verification etc. In this course we will discuss modern synthesis approaches by discussing foundational as well as recent research advances in this area. Topics covered in this course will include enumerative syntax-guided synthesis, counterexample-guided synthesis, stochastic synthesis and machine-learning based synthesis.\nAcademic Integrity: Plagiarism is viewed very seriously.

For instance, $|28|26|25|11|16|12|24|29|6|10|$ and $x = 17$ lead to the array $|10|6|12|11|16|25|24|29|26|28|$. We provide here a high level algorithmic description of the problem.\nEstablish the array $a[0,…,n]$ and the partitioning value $x$. Move the partitions towards each other until the wrongly placed elements are encountered. Allow for special cases such as $x$ being outside the range of array values. While the two partitions have not crossed over exchange the wrongly partitioned pair and extend both partitions inward by one element extend left partition while elements less tha or equal to $x$ extend the right partition while elements are greater than $x$ Return the partitioning index $p$ in the partitioned array. Give an algorithm to find the $k^{th}$ smallest element in a given randomly ordered array of $n$ elements. Note that one could solve the problem by first sorting the array and subsequently returning the $k^{th}$ element in the array as the solution. However, such sorting is unnecessary and costly. Use the partitioning strategy from Question(2) to develop a solution for this problem. We provide some hints to solving this problem:\nSet $l$ and $u$ to be the bounds of the array While $l \u0026lt; u$ do: Choose some random $x$ about which to partition the array Partition the array in to two partitions $A$ and $B$ marked by indices $i$ and $j$ Choose a partition to perform further search by using a test: if $j\u0026lt;k$ then $l:=i$, if $i\u0026gt;k$ then $u:=j$ Given a array of $n$ distinct integers, find the length of the longest monotone increasing subsequence. Consider an array: $|1|2|9|4|7|3|11|8|14|6|$. In this example the longest increasing subsequence is of $1,2,4,7,11,14$ and is of length 6. Note that in for a monotone increasing subsequence, the numbers are not required to be adjacent in the original array. A general algorithmic description is as follows:\nEstablish $a[0,…,n]$ of $n$ elements Set the initial condition of the longest subsequence terminating in the first position of the array For the remaining $n-1$ positions in the array do: if current element is less than the maximum in the longest previous set then locate the position and value of maximum among the predecessors and update the position and length of maximum, if required. Else, update the length, position of maximum and the maximum length so far. Return the length of longest monotone increasing sequence.

Modeling Concurrent Program Executions [CHALLENGING] Semantics of any program is generally defined by a set of executions. An execution of a program is composed of events. Events are either read (or write) from (or to) a location or fences. Events can also be classified into those that access atomic locations and those that access non-atomic ($nal$) locations. Events from the same thread are ordered w.r.t. each other via a total order called sequenced-before ($sb$). Other relations that may exist between events are:\ndependency relations such as address ($ad$), control ($cd$) or data ($dd$) dependency whether events are from the same thread ($sthd$) or accessing the same location ($ sloc$) reads-from (rf) relation – a relation containing edges to read actions from the write actions whose values they take, coherence-order ($co$) – a total order on distinct writes to the same atomic location) reads-from-external ( $rfe \\overset{\\mathrm{def}}{=} rf \\setminus sthd $) The constaints on the structure of basic well-formed executions are:\nRead, write, fence and $nal$ are drawn from the events $E$ that appear in the execution Fence operations are distinct from read and write events $sb$ is a intra-thread and strict partial order the nature of address, control and data dependencies (i.e., their relation to read and write events) $rf$ is well-formed if the related writes and read are to the same location and is injective. Simialrly, $co$ is well-formed if the writes are to the same location forms a strict partial order. $rfe$ is derived from $rf$. The above is not an exhaustive list. Some other simpler constriants coming straight from the natural definition of the relations have been left out. One can refer to the paper Mathematizing C++ Concurrency for natural definition of the relations mentioned above.\nRelease ($rel$) and acquire ($acq$) are atomic write and read events, respectively. A fence can also have release or acquire semantics. A consistent execution of a program with release and acquire events has the following constraints:\nA happens-before ($hb$) relation – created from $sb$ and the syncrhonisation of release and acquire events in the execution. $hb$ edges between events accessing the same location, together with $rf, co$ and $fr$ must not form cycles.

They will also introduce the issues involved in translation of algorithmic ideas into working programs. These courses are largely programming language independent, but will introduce major programming paradigms like the functional, imperative and object-oriented.\nWhy do I have to learn the principle of mathematical induction and invariants? What good are these? I can program effectively even without these.\nCorrectness is perhaps the most cruicial aspect of program design. Through these tools you will learn how to reason about the correctness of your algorithmic designs and programs. In the words of Prof Banerjee “It is the same reason why budding young cricketers are painstakingly taught batting techniques in cricket academies before they are encouraged to bat like Virendra Sehwag. While there may be geniuses who can hit the ball consistently out of the park with total disregard for foot positions and correctness of weight transfer while hitting the ball, most aspiring cricketers would do well to learn the basics of technique.”\nHow important is to master the syntax of the programming languages used in the course?\nWhile syntax is important to correctly compile your programs, it will be sufficient for you to know just enought syntax so that the programs used by the instructors in the class can be understood. Note the course is on principles and not on the detailed features of any programming language.\nI am finding the course hard. What can I do?\nTalk to your instructor and the TAs and let them know exactly what is bothering you. Be open to their suggestions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"508aef358d1f710236e9d159db0bd40e","permalink":"https://subodhvsharma.github.io/course/col100/faq/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/col100/faq/","section":"course","summary":"COL100 Frequently Asked Questions What can I expect to learn from these courses?\nThis course aims to introduce the methods of algorithmic thinking, analysis of correctness, and design of building blocks of efficient algorithmic procedures.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"course"}]
