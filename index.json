However, all students are required to write up all solutions entirely on their own. Any collaboration, or help taken, must be declared. Students are encouraged to refer to books, papers and internet resources. They may even consult other individuals. However, the source must be clearly cited if any part of the solution (or even an idea) is taken from such a source. Failure to declare any help taken will be interpreted as academic misconduct. Copying (in whole or in part) from others is deemed cheating and those who enable this activity either deliberately or through negligence are also deemed to have cheated. Cheating is a serious academic misconduct; it will attract a summary F grade to the involved students and referral to the discplinary committee.  Important Note to the Students   All academic matters, doubts etc. should be cleared during the lectures/tutorials or immediately after them, in the presence of the whole class, so that the clarifications does not have to be communicated to others separately.\n  In an online semester, when quizzes are announced beforehand, make adequate back-up arrangements for power failures and lack of internet connections, and have enough time for downloading and uploading your answers. No excuses for these will be considered valid.\n  Absence in quizzes will result in 0 for that quiz. Make-up quizzes will not be given out. A more elaborate note to the students can be found here\n  Attendance: The Institute requires a mandatory 75% attendance for all students, which includes time lost due to illness. However this course will require 100% attendance. Please inform the instructor if for any reason you cannot attend a class. Be warned that it will be difficult to make up if you miss classes.\n  Illness: In sickness or ill-health, a Medical Certificate from the Institute Sick Bay, or a doctor from an Institute-recognised hospital is necessary, especially if you request for a make-up test. Only in the case of serious illnesses will I consider giving an extension on assignments.\n  Make-up Tests: Make-up tests (minor or major exams only) will be given only when the student furnishes a valid documentation of illness for a period including the day of the exam.\n  Grading Policy  Quizzes: 12% Assignments: 28% Minor Exam(s): 30% Major Exam(s): 30%  As per the Institute regulations, an A grade will be awarded only over 80% and no student with less than 30% will be given a passing grade.\nAn I grade will be awarded only in the case of an illness during the major exam. A make-up exam will be scheduled at the earliest, and the I grade will be converted as soon as possible. However, please do your best to ensure that you donot break a leg or otherwise fall ill during examinations.

This is a direct result of programmers running away from designing abstractions and not sufficiently focussing on simplicity and clarity. Could we instead work with a simple language that captures the essential aspects of program design before we decide to develop such programs? Would it not be great to not only state the software abstractions of systems succinctly, but also analyse them fully automatically akin to the continuous integration model of software development? In this course, we shall study one such specification language called Alloy and learn to model system abstractions succinctly and incrementally. We shall also learn to apply Alloy analysis tool to models which will facilitate in finding deeps flaws early in the design process without having to explicitly write a ton of unit tests.\nReference Book Software Abstractions by Daniel Jackson\nReference Links  Alloy Online Tutorial Alloy Tutorial Slides  Guest Talks   Algorithmic Analysis of a Model Checking Partial Order Reduction Scheme Using Alloy by Prof. Stephen Siegel, Univesity of Delaware.\n  Exploring Memory Models using the Alloy Analyzer by Prof. John Wickerson, Imperial College London.\n  ","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"a5a0d0f94d11d645e21107cedf02b7c7","permalink":"https://subodhvsharma.github.io/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/spmoduleinsoftwaresystems-software-abstractions/","section":"course","summary":"Sem I (2020-21)","tags":null,"title":"COV 882 Special Module in Software Systems -- Software Abstractions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"General Information  Co-Instructor: Subodh Sharma (email: svs at cse.iitd.ac.in)  Semester: II, 2019-2020 Timings: Mon/Thur 09:30-11:00  Class Venue: LH 108 (Group 31-40)  Lab Venue: LH 502-505 \n Notice  All mails to the course instructor MUST have COL100 as the subject.

Course Overview Click here to see what the Courses of Study booklet has to say.\nCOL100: Introduction to Computer Science is intended for First Year B. Tech. students. The course COL100 addresses on the following issues:\n Problem formulation in a precise and concise fashion and independent of language considerations. The design of an algorithm from the problem specification \u0026ndash; its correctness and analysis of its efficiency. The intermediate steps in the design of a program from an algorithm through a process of step-wise refinement. Language dependent considerations may be used in this process, but not elsewhere.  The emphasis throughout the course is in the analysis required while designing correct and efficient algorithms. The course is intended to teach a student a systematic process of design - beginning with problem formulation from an informal specification, through convincing arguments to algorithms, the analysis of their correctness and efficiency, and finally arriving at programs through a process of step-wise refinement. A programming language bias is avoided and programs are developed in both imperative and functional styles.\nThe first part of the course introduces the basics of the functional and imperative models of computation, recursive and iterative processes, and the basics of programming using higher-order functions. The programming languages used for functional and imperative programming are Standard ML and Python, respectively.\nThe second part of the course introduces data-directed programming. It emphasizes on programming with records, lists, trees, arrays and developing abstract data types.\nThe third part of the course addresses the issues in design and analysis of simple algorithms. Examples are taken from Divide and conquer, Backtracking, Numerical algorithms, Randomized algorithms and Geometric algorithms.\nReferences The primary references is going to be the Lecture Notes on Introduction to Computing developed by Prof. Subhashis Banerjee and Prof. S.

First use the algorithm given by the following functional description: $fib(1) = 1; fib(2) = 1; fib(n) = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)$ for $n \u0026gt; 2$. Also develop iterative algorithms for the same problem. The integer square root of $n$ is the integer $k$ such that $k^2 \\leq n \u0026lt; (k+1)^2$.

Modeling Concurrent Program Executions [CHALLENGING] Semantics of any program is generally defined by a set of executions. An execution of a program is composed of events. Events are either read (or write) from (or to) a location or fences. Events can also be classified into those that access atomic locations and those that access non-atomic ($nal$) locations. Events from the same thread are ordered w.r.t. each other via a total order called sequenced-before ($sb$). Other relations that may exist between events are:\n dependency relations such as address ($ad$), control ($cd$) or data ($dd$) dependency whether events are from the same thread ($sthd$) or accessing the same location ($ sloc$) reads-from (rf) relation \u0026ndash; a relation containing edges to read actions from the write actions whose values they take, coherence-order ($co$) \u0026ndash; a total order on distinct writes to the same atomic location) reads-from-external ( $rfe \\overset{\\mathrm{def}}{=} rf \\setminus sthd $)  The constaints on the structure of basic well-formed executions are:\n Read, write, fence and $nal$ are drawn from the events $E$ that appear in the execution Fence operations are distinct from read and write events $sb$ is a intra-thread and strict partial order the nature of address, control and data dependencies (i.e., their relation to read and write events) $rf$ is well-formed if the related writes and read are to the same location and is injective. Simialrly, $co$ is well-formed if the writes are to the same location forms a strict partial order. $rfe$ is derived from $rf$.  The above is not an exhaustive list. Some other simpler constriants coming straight from the natural definition of the relations have been left out. One can refer to the paper Mathematizing C++ Concurrency for natural definition of the relations mentioned above.\nRelease ($rel$) and acquire ($acq$) are atomic write and read events, respectively. A fence can also have release or acquire semantics. A consistent execution of a program with release and acquire events has the following constraints:\n A happens-before ($hb$) relation \u0026ndash; created from $sb$ and the syncrhonisation of release and acquire events in the execution. $hb$ edges between events accessing the same location, together with $rf, co$ and $fr$ must not form cycles. Note that $fr$ relates each read to all of the writes that are coherence-ordered later than the write that the read observed.  Implement the basic execution modeling in Alloy and extend your model to the release-acquire fragment of C11. Show litmus execution behaviours of consistent executions, data race-free and with race executions.\nReport  Create a report in latex and explain how you iteratively refined the model and how did Alloy help you to indentify counter-examples in your modeling process.
